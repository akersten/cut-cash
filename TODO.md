- Maybe add date control back if it's useful
-- Formatter and parser

- Don't allow deleting a payer if they are on receipts...
- Check to see that deleting and adding a payer doesn't get confused with a previous payer

- better overall style/formatting
- different font size and colors for DynamicLabel (able to edit payer names)

- Rounding is a little wonky with lots of values (difference gets larger). maybe don't round until the end.
